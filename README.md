Hi, I’m Esther 👋

I work at the intersection of AI systems, human workflows, and real-world constraints.

My background is in product and people leadership in regulated environments
(insurance, customer communication, formal decision processes).
I currently focus on the practical use of LLMs and agentic systems
where accountability, explainability, and human oversight actually matter.

I’m less interested in hype-driven demos
and more in AI that survives contact with reality.

---

## What I care about

- Designing AI systems **with constraints**, not despite them  
- Small and medium-sized LLMs that can be understood, audited, and trusted  
- Agentic AI that supports humans instead of quietly replacing responsibility  
- Language, tone, and meaning — especially in customer-facing processes  
- Bridging the gap between technical capability and organizational reality  

I believe constraints are not a limitation.
They are where responsibility begins.

## What you’ll find here

My repositories are not frameworks or products.
They are thinking spaces.

You’ll find:
- conceptual notes on constraint-based AI design  
- small, explainable agent sketches  
- examples rooted in real-world processes rather than benchmarks  
- reflections on alignment, safety, and practical deployment  

Less “look what I built”, more “this is how I reason”.

## Background

- Product & people leadership in insurance  
- Hands-on work with customer letters, formal communication, and regulated workflows  
- Practical experience with LLMs, prompt design, and agentic patterns  
- Strong focus on explainability, traceability, and human-in-the-loop systems  

I’m particularly interested in environments where AI must be:
understandable, defensible, and ethically grounded.

---

## Currently exploring

- Constraint-driven agent design  
- AI support for formal and semi-formal communication  
- Alignment beyond theory: how it plays out in daily operations  
- Translating complex AI concepts into human language  

---

## Collaboration

If you’re interested in pragmatic AI design,
alignment in real organizations,
or thoughtful collaboration across tech and non-tech domains,
feel free to reach out.

I value clarity, depth, and mutual respect over speed.

## **Wie du mit mir arbeiten kannst**
- **Für Mistral/Hugging Face:** Ich suche Rollen, die *Constraint-Based AI* und *Resonant Systems* vorantreiben.
- **Für Forschung:** Ich teile gerne meine *praktischen* Erfahrungen mit LLMs in regulierten Umgebungen.
- **Für Workshops:** Ich erkläre, wie man KI *menschlich* gestaltet (nicht nur „effizient“).
